Housing in the U.S.
In the United States, there is not enough available housing. This has caused the cost of housing to go up and be more expensive. It is called a “housing crisis.”
New immigrants and refugees may have a hard time finding an affordable place to live. It may take some time and you may not get exactly what you want in a home. It is important to know all of your options.
Short-term housing 
Short-term housing is a place where you live temporarily. It is for a short time, usually for a few days or months. Options for this may include a:
Hotel
Shared apartment or house    
Homeless shelter
Transitional housing 
Homeless shelter
Homeless shelters offer a temporary place to sleep. Most shelters are free and offer meals. Shelters often try to keep families together but generally have separate sleeping areas for men and women. They have rules you must follow, such as some might have a curfew or limits on what you can bring.
Transitional housing
Transitional housing helps people move from homelessness to a permanent home by providing a place to stay for a longer time. It can be free or low-cost. It may include other support like job training and help finding a stable home.
Your immigration status should not affect whether you can stay at a homeless shelter or transitional housing.

Rent a home
Many people rent apartments or houses in the United States. You can rent a place from a private owner or a property management company.
You will most likely have to:
Fill out an application that asks about your income, work, and past rentals. It also asks for your social security number to check your background and credit. 
Sign a lease agreement if your application is approved. This is a legal contract between the tenant and landlord. You agree to the dates of the rental, cost, and conditions. Leases are usually for one year. 
Pay a security deposit and the first month’s rent.
Pay rent monthly as well as utilities, such as electricity. 
A tenant is a person who is renting a home. A landlord is a person who rents the home to the tenant.
Before you start looking for a place to rent, make sure you know how much you can afford to pay. Generally, it is best to pay around 30% of the amount of money you make a month. 
Tips for getting a home to rent
If you have trouble being approved for a rental, you can have someone cosign for you or find a roommate who can apply with you.
If you cannot afford a place to live, Public Housing Agencies (PHAs) are a good place to start. The U.S. government offers public or subsidized housing with lower rent. Housing vouchers can also help you pay rent. These housing benefits are available to:
Refugees and asylees
Humanitarian parolees 
Grantees of withholding of removal 
If you are undocumented or have temporary immigration status, you are not eligible for these programs. You can still live with a family member who is in the program and has legal immigration status.
Sharing a rental with other people can also help you afford a place to live.
Buy a home
The majority of people in the United States own a home. Owning a home can help create stability and build wealth. You do not have to be a U.S. citizen to buy a home.
Many homeowners get a mortgage or loan to help buy a home. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) offers information about buying a home and counseling to help review your options.  
Find housing and help
There are websites and places in your community that post available housing options. Check bulletin boards in your local community centers, libraries, and places of worship.
Some websites you can try include:
Short-term housing: hotels.com, Airbnb
Shared housing: Facebook marketplace, craigslist, roommates.com
Rentals: Zillow, HotPads, RentCafe, 4stay, apartments.com

Family Details:
How many people will be living in the house? According to HUD guidance, an occupancy policy of two persons per bedroom is generally considered reasonable under current federal laws
Do you have any specific needs (e.g., accessibility for disabled family members)?
The Fair Housing Act (revised in 1998) applies to all multifamily housing complexes with more than four units built after 1991, regardless of ownership. Under this law, units are required to meet new construction requirements including accessibility features called “universal design.” Accessibility features in universal design include accessible common use areas, at least one accessible building entrance, and doors and hallways wide enough for people using wheelchairs.
Reasonable Accommodation What is reasonable accommodation? Reasonable Accommodation is a protection of the Fair Housing Act that gives people with disabilities the right to request modification, within reason, in rules, policies, practices, services, and physical amenities, e.g., wide doors, safety bars in bathrooms, that allow them total use of a rental property. Who can request reasonable accommodation? Any person with a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits their major life activities. Who pays for reasonable accommodation or modification? Under the FHA, once an accommodation is deemed reasonable, a housing provider is responsible to pay the costs of the change unless it is an undue financial and administrative burden as determined by the specific circumstances and relevant decision-making authority. Examples of reasonable accommodation: • Assigning an accessible parking space for a tenant with mobility challenges • Permitting a tenant to move to a ground floor unit due to mobility impairment • Adjusting rent payments to align with income disability assistance payment dates • Adding grab bars in bathrooms or allowing a tenant with impaired manual dexterity to replace locks or door handles with adaptations • Allowing a newcomer to have a live-in-aide; or permit a service animal in a No Pets building for a tenant who needs it for physical and emotional support
Location Preferences:
Do you need to be close to public transportation?
Most communities have one or more forms of public transportation. Refugees will need to know how to use each type and how to do so safely.
Owning and driving a car in the United States can be expensive. There are also laws regarding car insurance, driver’s licenses, and safety that car owners need to understand and obey.
